      heading: Our History
      content: We have been breeding Toy Poodles for many years and have a deep
        understanding of the breed. Our breeding stock is carefully selected and
        health tested to ensure that we are producing the healthiest puppies
        possible. We also take great care in socializing our puppies from a
        young age to ensure that they are well-adjusted and confident.

        Our Toy Poodles come in a variety of colors including white, apricot,
        black, and silver. They are hypoallergenic and non-shedding, making them
        a great choice for people with allergies. They are also small in size,
        typically weighing between 4 and 6 pounds, making them the perfect size
        for apartment living or for those who want a small companion.
